## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **How do I implement the mobile menu toggle feature?**

  - create a function that opens and closes the menu in your javascript file and pass it as an event handler to the onclick lister for the hamburger button. Refer to the block of codes (lines 48-51) in script.js file in the project.

- **How do I make some features or elements show in the mobile version and disappear in the destop version and vice versa?**

  - if you want element A to show in the mobile and not in the desktop version, what you do is, in the media queries for desktop apply the rule of "display:none" to the css selector  of element A. On the other hand, if you want it to show in the destop version and not in the mobile, apply "display:none" rule to it in the media queries for mobile and for the same selector of element A you apply the "display:block" rule in the media query for the desktop.
